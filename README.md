#### Summary:
A simple Web Application that allows the User to select a city/metro area and an occupation to find out how much the chosen occupation pays in that city as well as what is that average cost of rent for a 2-bedroom appartment in the city chosen by the user. The user can then make a new query and see the results listed right above the results from the first query, allowing a side by side comparison of the results for each query.
Note: This is a demo-version, there is a limitted amount of pre-selected cities and occupations for the user to choose from
